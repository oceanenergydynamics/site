        <h2>Our Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>
            At Ocean Energy Dynamics, we strive to revolutionize the maritime industry by harnessing the immense power of ocean waves.
            Our mission is to reduce fossil fuel dependency, create sustainable energy solutions, and help vessels operate efficiently
            and cost-effectively. Our vision is a world where the seas fuel progress while preserving the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            With cutting-edge wave energy technology and a commitment to innovation, we are building a future where clean energy drives
            sustainable maritime operations globally.

    <!-- The Problem & Our Solution Section -->
    <section id="problem-solution" class="container fade-in">
        <h2>The Problem & Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            The maritime industry faces two critical challenges: reliance on fossil fuels and high operational costs. These issues not
            only harm the environment but also burden vessel operators financially. Traditional energy solutions fall short of meeting
            the needs of a cleaner and more cost-effective future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ocean Energy Dynamics addresses these challenges with a revolutionary wave energy generator system. Our system captures
            the energy of ocean waves, converts it into renewable electricity, and integrates seamlessly into ship operations. By doing so,
            we provide a practical and impactful alternative to fossil fuels, enabling vessels to operate sustainably while reducing costs.

        <h2>Our Innovation</h2>
        <p>
            Ocean Energy Dynamics has developed a groundbreaking wave energy system that transforms wave motion into renewable energy.
            Our innovative design ensures efficiency, scalability, and durability. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Water Entry</b>: Ocean water enters through a one-way inlet system equipped with filters to block debris and protect marine life.</li>
            <li><b>Turbulence Reduction</b>: The water flows through grids that eliminate chaotic currents, ensuring smooth energy transfer.</li>
            <li><b>Oscillators</b>: Heavy oscillators move with the waves, converting kinetic energy into hydraulic energy.</li>
            <li><b>Hydraulic Turbine</b>: Pressurized hydraulic fluid powers turbines, generating consistent electricity.</li>
            <li><b>Propulsion Assistance</b>: Remaining water exits through a jet stream, aiding vessel propulsion and reducing drag.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Our innovation is adaptable to vessels of all sizes, from small yachts to large ships, and requires minimal maintenance, ensuring
            long-term performance.
