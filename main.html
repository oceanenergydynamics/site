    <!-- Mission and Problem -->
    <section id="mission-problem" class="container">
        <h2>Our Mission and The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Ocean Energy Dynamics addresses two major pain points in the maritime industry: cost inefficiency and environmental impact. Our mission is to redefine maritime energy through sustainable solutions, harnessing wave power to create eco-friendly, cost-effective systems specifically tailored for yachts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cost Inefficiency:</strong> Luxury yachts face significant operating expenses, with fuel accounting for approximately 30% of total costs. For instance, a 70-meter yacht consumes over 8,300 liters of fuel for every 100 nautical miles, costing upwards of $7,500 per trip. Traditional engines, with 90% more moving parts, require extensive maintenance, further escalating costs. Renewable alternatives like solar panels and wind turbines are often impractical due to their large space requirements and high installation costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> The global yacht industry contributes significantly to carbon emissions. A single 70-meter yacht emits approximately 26.4 metric tons of COâ‚‚ over a 100-nautical mile journey, exacerbating climate change. Beyond emissions, environmental risks include oil spills and ocean pollution associated with fuel transport and storage. The maritime sector urgently needs sustainable solutions to reduce its environmental footprint.

                <strong>1. Wave Capture</strong>
                <p>Waves enter through a one-way inlet, powering internal oscillators to start the energy generation process.</p>

                <strong>2. Energy Conversion</strong>
                <p>Oscillators drive hydraulic pistons, compressing fluid to spin turbines, converting wave motion into energy.</p>

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section id="our-story" class="container">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Ocean Energy Dynamics began as a bold idea shared by a group of passionate innovators who sought to tackle the pressing challenges of fuel dependency and environmental degradation in the maritime industry. With diverse expertise in engineering, business strategy, and environmental science, our team came together to design a solution that marries sustainability with practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
            From early brainstorming sessions to prototyping and testing, our journey has been driven by a singular vision: to create a renewable energy system that transforms how ships harness and use energy. What started as a school project has evolved into a groundbreaking innovation poised to reshape the future of maritime travel.
